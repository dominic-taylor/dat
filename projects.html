            <h4>Digital Profile Project</h4>
            <p>I was contracted as an assistant to a research project at Victoria University of Wellington, looking    into how people use technology.
             My role was to take the raw data, stored on Google Sheets, and create a visualsation based on it. I also had to make a solution that would be easily useable by members of the project once my contract ended.
             To achieve this I wrote a Node.js program that stripped the data from three .tsv (tab-seperated-value) files and wrote it to a JSON-like file (more on that later), fit for the type of D3.js graph we had decided to use. This meant a user could replace any of the .tsv files if new information was added and run the program to get a new graph. The graph has about 560 data points, belonging to categories and sub categories, which are ultimatley connected to a central node. I added functionality so users could mouse over the points for more information on the data and relationships between categories. </p></li>
