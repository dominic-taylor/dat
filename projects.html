                <p>I was contracted as an assistant to a research project at Victoria University of Wellington, looking into how people use technology.
                 My job was to take the raw data, stored on Google Sheets and create a visualsation based on it. The solution also had to be easily useable by members of the project once my contract ended.</p>
                 <p>As Sheets can be downloaded as tab-separated value (.tsv ) files, I wrote a Node.js program that stripped and formatted the data based on this delimiter and loaded it into a prepared D3.js graph. So when new information is added, a user replaces the relevant .tsv files and runs the program to get a new graph. </p>
                 <p>The idea of the visualsation was to give context to hundreds of data points, categories and sub categories. I added functionality so users could mouse over the points for more information and relationships between categories, as well as select data points which could be downloaded as a text file.</p>

               <p>My final project at EDA was a web app that led users on a trail of Wellington landmarks. This was a group project and my main role was coding functions that compared the user’s geo-coordinates to those in our database. I did this by reading the documentation on the JavaScript geolocation API, and writing tests for my functions based on how we wanted to use it. I also built React components and integrated an OAuth login feature which let users to have their Facebook name and profile picture added to a leader board.</p>
               <p>
                My team and I built Trails over a week of 12 hour days and we used Agile to pace ourselves and be effective. In my role as ‘Time Catcher’ I was responsible for monitoring our task schedule as well as holding stand-ups to see how everyone was feeling and handling the work- load. This ensured good communication and culture, making new features easier to add and a smoother workflow. </p>

              <p>A friend and I did this project in order to get a handle on Redux. SpinVision grabs a dozen(?) results from a film database API and displays them in a nice grid as a poster and summary. A user can specify a genre and year or let it be completely random.
                What were the challenges? The concept of Redux is nice and elegant but the implementation and docs are pretty obtuse. How did we overcome them? Ultimaly it was a challenge of problem solving, so I copied the most simple example I could find and followed the data step by step through the app until I understood how Redux worked and could use it in our project.</p>
