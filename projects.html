                <p>I was contracted as an assistant to a research project at Victoria University of Wellington, looking at how people use technology. My job was to take the raw data, stored on Google Sheets and create a visualsation based on it. The solution also had to be easily useable by members of the project once my contract ended.</p>
                 <p>As Sheets can be downloaded as tab-separated value (.tsv ) files, I wrote a Node.js program that stripped and formatted the data based on this delimiter and loaded it into a prepared D3.js graph. So when new information is added, a user replaces the relevant .tsv files and runs the program to get a new graph. </p>
                 <p>The idea of the visualsation was to give context to hundreds of data points, categories and sub categories. I added functionality so users could mouse over the points for more information and relationships between categories, as well as select data points which could be downloaded as a text file.</p>

               <p>My final project at EDA was a web app that led users on a trail of Wellington landmarks. This was a group project and my main role was coding functions that compared the user’s geo-coordinates to those in our database.</p><p> I did this by reading the documentation on the JavaScript geolocation API, and writing tests for my functions based on how we wanted to use it. I also built React components and integrated an OAuth login feature which let users to have their Facebook name and profile picture added to a leader board.</p>
               <p>
                My team and I built Trails over a week of 12 hour days and we used Agile to pace ourselves and be effective. As ‘Time Catcher’ I was responsible for monitoring our task schedule as well as holding stand-ups to see how everyone was feeling and handling the work- load. This ensured good communication and culture, making new features easier to add and a smoother workflow. </p>

              <p>A friend and I did this project in order to get a handle on Redux. SpinVision calls a film database API and displays the results in a nice grid as a poster and summary. A user can specify a genre and year or let it be completely random.</p>
                <p>The concept of Redux is elegant but I found the implementation and docs a bit obtuse. In React terms, essentially it works by handing all of your components state information and managment to a 'store'. The store is available to the top-level parent of your components and can then pass the state down as props to the rest of the app.</p><p>Ultimaly the challenge was understanding how the elements of the system relate to each other and the jargon used to describe them. A big help was following the data step by step through the most basic example I could find, then through our code, until I understood how Redux worked.</p>

               <p>This is a project I did soon after graduating from Ensprial. The concept is a user can create a username and password, which lets them save and load a list of tasks. I chose this because authentication and databases were two concepts I wanted to be confident in.</p><p>For the users I made my own validation and login system which used the bcrpyt library and saved it to a Postgres database. Each user has a id and can save a list of tasks in the database associated with them.</p>
              <p>Going forward, I will incorportate them into other projects.</p>
